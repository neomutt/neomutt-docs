Notes
=====

- A C99 compiler (such as GCC) is required.

- You must also have a SysV compatible curses library, or you must
  install either

	GNU ncurses, ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/
  or
	S-Lang, ftp://space.mit.edu/pub/davis/slang/

- Mutt needs an implementation of the iconv API for character set
  conversions.  A free one can be found under the following URL:

	http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/

- For building the manual, mutt needs the DocBook XSL stylesheets
  as well as the DocBook DTD as of version 4.2 installed locally.


Installation
============

Installing Mutt is rather painless through the use of the GNU
autoconf package.  Simply untar the Mutt distribution, and run the
``configure'' script.  If you have obtained the distribution from
the Mercurial repository, run the ``prepare'' script with the same command
line parameters you would pass to configure.  It will set up mutt's
build environment and add the files which are present in the tar
balls, but not in the Mercurial repository.

In most cases, configure will automatically determine everything it
needs to know in order to compile.  However, there are a few options
to ``configure'' to help it out, or change the default behavior:

--prefix=DIR
	install Mutt in DIR instead of /usr/local

--with-curses=DIR
	use the curses lib in DIR/lib.  If you have ncurses, ``configure''
	will automatically look in /usr/include/ncurses for the include
	files.

--with-slang[=DIR]
	use the S-Lang library instead of ncurses.  This library seems to
	work better for some people because it is less picky about proper
	termcap entries than ncurses.  It is recommended that you use at
	*least* version 0.99-38 with Mutt.

--with-mailpath=DIR
	specify where the spool mailboxes are located on your system

--with-homespool[=FILE]
	treat file in the user's home directory as the spool mailbox.  Note
	that this is *not* the full pathname, but relative to the user's
	home directory.  Defaults to "mailbox" if FILE is not specified.

--with-gss[=PFX]
	Enable GSSAPI authentication to IMAP servers. This should work with
	both MIT and Heimdal GSSAPI implementations - others haven't been
	tested. Note that the Cyrus SASL library also supports GSSAPI,
	and may be able to encrypt your session with it - you should use
	SASL instead if you can.

--with-ssl[=PFX]
	enable SSL support with IMAP and POP. SSL support requires you to
	have OpenSSL headers and libraries properly installed before
	compiling.  If the OpenSSL headers and libraries are not in the
	default system pats you can use the optional PFX argument to
	define the root directory of your installation.  The libraries
	are then expected to be found in PFX/lib and headers in
	PFX/include/openssl.

--with-sasl[=PFX]
	Use the Cyrus SASL library for IMAP or POP authentication. This
	library provides generic support for several authentication methods,
	and more may be added by the system administrator without recompiling
	mutt. SASL may also be able to encrypt your mail session even if
	SSL is not available.

--disable-nls
	This switch disables mutt's native language support.

--enable-flock
	use flock() to lock files.

--disable-fcntl
	by default, Mutt uses fcntl() to lock files.  Over NFS this can
	result in poor performance on read/write.

--enable-locales-fix
	on some systems, the result of isprint() can't be used reliably
	to decide which characters are printable, even if you set the
	LANG environment variable.  If you set this option, Mutt will
	assume all characters in the ISO-8859-* range are printable.  If
	you leave it unset, Mutt will attempt to use isprint() if either
	of the environment variables LANG, LC_ALL or LC_CTYPE is set,
	and will revert to the ISO-8859-* range if they aren't.
	If you need --enable-locales-fix then you will probably need
	--without-wc-funcs too. However, on a correctly configured
	modern system you shouldn't need either (try setting LANG,
	LC_ALL or LC_CTYPE instead).

--without-wc-funcs
	by default Mutt uses the functions mbrtowc(), wctomb() and
	wcwidth() provided by the system, when they are available.
	With this option Mutt will use its own version of those
	functions, which should work with 8-bit display charsets, UTF-8,
	euc-jp or shift_jis, even if the system doesn't normally support
	those multibyte charsets.

	If you find Mutt is displaying non-ascii characters as octal
	escape sequences (e.g. \243), even though you have set LANG and
	LC_CTYPE correctly, then you might find you can solve the problem
	with either or both of --enable-locales-fix and --without-wc-funcs.

Once ``configure'' has completed, simply type ``make install.''

Mutt should compile cleanly (without errors) and you should end up with a
binary called ``mutt.''  If you get errors about undefined symbols like
A_NORMAL or KEY_MIN, then you probably don't have a SysV compliant curses
library.  You should install either ncurses or S-Lang (see above), and then
run the ``configure'' script again.

Please note that "VPATH" builds currently only work with GNU make (gmake).



Character set support
=====================

Mutt no longer contains functions for doing character set conversion.
Instead, it expects the iconv functions (iconv_open, iconv,
iconv_close) to be provided. Most up-to-date systems provide these
functions, often as part of the C library. If you are installing Mutt
on a system which does not have them, it is recommended that you
install Bruno Haible's portable libiconv library, which you can obtain
from:

	       ftp://ftp.ilog.fr/pub/Users/haible/gnu/

Even if your system does provide the iconv functions, you might want
to install libiconv, as some systems provide only a very limited
version of iconv.


If you decide to use your system's iconv implementation, you may
need to tell mutt about implementation-defined names for some
character sets.  Sample configuration files for various systems can
be found in the directory contrib/iconv/ in this source
distribution, and will be installed in the samples/iconv directory
as part of mutt's documentation.

In order to use these sample configuration files, just put a line
like

     source /usr/local/doc/mutt/samples/iconv/iconv.osf1-4.0d.rc

into your system's global Muttrc, which normally resides in /etc or
/usr/local/etc.


If you really want to, you can configure Mutt --disable-iconv, but
there will then be no character set conversion.
